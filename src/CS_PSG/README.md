# STANDARD DISCLAIMERS
- My coding style has made it mostly unmodified through every language I have coded in since around 1977.
  - The minor changes required have been a lot less painful than trying to keep up with the proposed standards for all of the languages I have encountered in that time,
  - A far from exhaustive list of those languages is:
    - Punch card DEC 10 and IBM System III Pascal.
    - Punch card COBOL.
    - Punch card FORTRAN on DEC 10 and 20.
    - Motorola 6800, 6809, 68000-68060 assembly code.
    - Apple and Super PET 2000 UCSD Pascal.
    - Commodore CP/M Pascal.
    - Python.
    - Structured BASIC on Amiga machines.
    - Highly modified but still recognizably on all forms of Microsoft BASIC that came on Apple, CBM, Atari, and other 8 and 16 bit machines or their first cartridges.
  - In short, your complaints about my coding style will be ignored unless they are genuine improvements which I can include in the next iteration of my style.
